==================

  * update trait handling to omit all cases of special traits from attributes
    
    Previously, the way this integration was written, "top-level" user attributes (email, first name, last name, phone) would be erroneously included twice if sent in anything but camel-case â€” once in their respective top level parameters and once in the catch-all `attributes` sub-object.
    
    That's redundant, and not how our server-side integration works. This fix eliminates that behavior so that the top-level attributes are excluded from the catch-all `attributes` sub-object.
